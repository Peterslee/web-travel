            <p class="text">
              Himmeltindan has the highest elevation of any mountain on the 
              central Lofoten island of Vestvågøya. One of the highest peaks 
              in the region and the highest on its island. It provides the best 
              view of the southeast chain of Lofoten that we saw during our stay.

            <p class="text">
              Tromsø is the largest city in Northern Norway. With a location at nearly 70° north, 
              and between fjords, mountain peaks, and islands, it is a prime starting point 
              for your Arctic adventure. The city is situated in the middle of the auroral oval, 
              the area with the highest probability of seeing the northern lights.
